      <p>Hing or asafoetida is the dried and powdered resin which is native to Iran and Afghanistan but now mainly cultivated in India. It is one of the important kitchen ingredients used in many Indian recipes. Asafoetida in its raw form is sold as blocks which look like pieces of shiny of resin. However in the stores it is more commonly found in it's powdered form.</p>
      <p>Asafoetida along known as hing or peringayam is used a lot in Indian cooking and more so in South indian cooking. It is used as a condiment in flavoring sabzi, dal, sambar, rasam, poriyals and more. </p>
      <p>It's always important to choose the right kind of asafoetida, you need to smell its intense pungent flavors when you open the box. Below is one of my favorite recipe which uses asafoetida. The Murungai Keerai Sambar, where asafoetida is a core ingredient.</p>
