        <p>Dhokla recipe is a tasty, healthy, vegan, steamed snack from Gujarat made with chickpea flour (besan) and tempering of Indian spices. Dhokla recipe is very easy to make using minimal, everyday ingredients which include chickpea flour, yoghurt and Indian spices. This savoury, steamed vegetarian snack is from the state of Gujarat. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to categorise it as one of the healthiest and tasty snacks of India. Also known as khaman dhokla, it is a very popular street food throughout the country though it has its origins in the western part of India.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <p>Heat the cooker or water with 2 cups water. While the steam is building up in the cooker/steamer, prepare the dhokla batter.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Grease a stainless steel round vessel or aluminium cake tin and set aside.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>In a wide bowl, add the sieved chickpea flour, semolina, salt, turmeric powder, asafoetida, green chilli-ginger paste and oil. Mix well. Add yoghurt and mix to form a thick mixture. Slowly adding water, a little at a time, to form a smooth, thick, pouring consistency batter.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Beat the batter in one direction for 2 minutes. Mix a tsp of water in Eno salt and citric acid and mix and immediately add to the batter and mix with a light hand. It will increase in volume and become frothy.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Immediately pour this batter into the greased tin and place in the cooker or steamer. Place lid and steam on a medium flame for 12 to 14 minutes.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Check with a toothpick by pricking in the centre of the dhokla. If it comes out clean, the dhokla is cooked. Turn off heat, remove the vessel from the cooker and cool slightly.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>In a pan, add water and sugar and bring to a boil. Turn off the flame. Add lemon juice and mix well. Pour this over the dhokla.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Heat oil in a small pan for tempering. Once hot, add mustard seeds and allow to splutter. Add cumin seeds, sesame seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves and roast for a few seconds.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Pour this tempering all over the dhokla. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and grated fresh coconut. Let the dhokla rest for at least 20 minutes for the flavours to be absorbed.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Only after the dhokla has cooled down completely, cut into square pieces and place on a serving tray. Serve with green chutney or tomato ketchup.</p> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keerai vadai, a crispy savory South Indian snack, made with black gram dal, greens and chilies that’s served with coconut chutney. Keerai vadai makes for a perfect festive dish to celebrate Ugadi, the Telugu New Year which falls on April 8th, 2016. Keerai vadai is a urad dal based deep-fried crispy appetizer that has a variety of greens going into it.</p>
        <ul>

          <li> <p>Drain the water from the soaked urad dal and grind to a coarse paste adding very little water, approx 4-5 tbsps only. You should feel small bits of dal in the batter.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Place the ground urad dal in a large bowl. Add the chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, spinach, coriander, mint and curry leaves. Add salt and beat the mixture with you hand for a minute.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Heat oil for deep frying in a heavy bottomed vessel. Wet your hand in water, take a large ball of the urad dal mixture in your hand and place it on a moistened plastic sheet. Shape into a flat vadai and make a hole in the center.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Carefully place the shaped vadai in the hot oil. Reduce flame to medium high and make one or two more vadai in the same manner and place in the hot oil. Cook on medium high heat on both sides. You can increase flame towards the end of the cooking process and cook the vadai till crisp and golden brown.</p> </li>
        </ul>
