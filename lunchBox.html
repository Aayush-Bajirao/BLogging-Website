        <p>A quick and easy masala sevai recipe that makes for a tasty breakfast or evening snack. An example of a fuss-free meal to make when you have little time on hand is todayâ€™s masala idiyappam or masala sevai. The basic tomato green peas based masala mishmash is distinctively salty with a heady masala flavor, but after the instant noodles are mixed in it, the sevai absorbs the outstanding flavors yielding a pleasant yet addictive taste. This dish can be enjoyed on its own making it a truly fuss-free recipe.</p>
        <ul>

          <li> <p>Boil 4 to 5 cups of water, add the rice sevai along with 1/4 tsp salt and a tsp of oil. Once the sevai is cooked (it should be just soft and not mushy), turn off heat, pour into a colander to drain completely and set aside. The sevai cooks fast unlike vermicelli so watch out while it's boiling.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Heat oil and ghee in a cooking vessel, add the mustard seeds and allow to splutter. Add the green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, and curry leaves and saute them till a nice aroma emanates the kitchen.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Add the chopped onions, green chillis, and the grated ginger and saute for 4 mins. Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder and salt to taste. Mix to combine.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Add the chopped tomatoes and saute on medium heat for 4 mins. Add the boiled green peas. Cook for 4 mins.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Now, add the cooked sevai and mix it lightly to combine well and see that no lumps form. Garnish with coriander leaves. Turn off heat.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Serve hot with any pickle of your choice.</p> </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Breakfast is an important meal in our home and I try to incorporate healthy ingredients into the first meal of the day. Not only does the dish have to be healthy but it should be quick and simple to prepare too. Wheat rava idli recipe falls under the category of an easy and healthy breakfast dish. Like idli, South Indian steamed rice cakes, it makes for a lighter, but equally delicious option. These vibrant, carrot-flecked, visually appealing steamed beauties are a breeze to make. In fact, the vibrant colour of this instant wheat rava idli is due to the addition of carrot and not turmeric powder.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <p>Heat a heavy bottomed vessel, drizzle a few drops of ghee or oil. Add the broken wheat and dry roast it for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Remove from heat and place in a bowl.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>In the same vessel, add ghee. Once hot, add mustard seeds and allow to splutter. Add the urad dal and allow to turn red. If using broken cashew nuts, add them and roast till red. Add asafoetida and curry leaves and roast for a few seconds. Add the grated carrot and stir fry for 4-5 minutes and turn off heat.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Wash the roasted dalia or broken wheat. Add the tempering and stir fried carrot mixture to the roasted broken wheat along with chopped coriander leaves.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Add the sour curd and salt and mix well. Add a little water (approx 1/3 cup) to make a smooth thick batter. It should not be too thick nor too thin. Cover and set aside for 20 minutes.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>You will find that the water is absorbed by the broken wheat. Add more water (as required) to make thick yet flowing batter.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Grease idli plates and add 2 cups water to your cooker or steamer and place the vessel on low flame.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Add eno salt to the prepared wheat rava idli batter and mix in one direction. The batter will increase in volume slightly. Immediately, pour the batter into the grease idli plates and steam for 15-17 minutes.</p> </li>
          <li> <p>Turn off heat, remove the wheat rava idlis to a serving plate and serve with any chutney of your choice.</p> </li>
