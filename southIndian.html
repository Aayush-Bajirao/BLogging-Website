      <p>South Indian Recipes: Find here list of 13 best south Indian recipes like chicken chettinad, masala dosa, meen murringakka curry, chicken stew with appams, Hyderabadi biryani and many more with key ingredients and how to make process.</p>
      <p>Best South Indian Recipes:The smell of crisp vadas, the sound of spluttering mustard seeds, the taste of piping-hot sambar made with fresh tamarind, and the touch of feather-light, soft  idlis - there's no doubt that South Indian food is a treat to the senses. Dosa and chutney are just a brief trailer to a colourful, rich and absolutely fascinating culinary journey that is South India. With its 5 states, 2 union territories, rocky plateau, river valleys and coastal plains, the south of India is extremely different from its Northern counterpart. Needless to say, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have their own cuisines that are rooted in their history and culture.  </p>
      <p>But before we get stuck into details like ingredients and cooking techniques, let's talk about some aspects that are common to those that live in the South. Firstly, most people eat with their right hand and leave the left one clean for drinking water. Also, licking curry off your finger does taste really good! Rice is their grain of choice and lentils and daals are equally important. Sambhar, which is made with lentil, tamarind and buttermilk is also common to all South Indian states, though each region may have its own variation.</p>
      <p>Pickles and Pappadams are always served on the side and yogurt makes a frequent appearance as well. Coconut is one of the most important ingredients and is used in various forms: dry, desiccated or as is. Some of the cooking is also done in coconut oil. The South of India is known as 'the land of spices' and for all the right reasons. Cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, chilli, mustard, curry leaves - the list goes on.</p>
