      <p>To put out healthy wholesome meals at home for your family, we need to have our preparation done. Right from planning menus for the meals, to having all the ingredients in place, a lot of coordination is required for this.  Above all, grocery shopping needs to be done from time to time, of fresh produce and dry ingredients required to put out a meal. </p>
      <p>1. Shop efficiently by planning your weekly meals</p>
      <p>The first step to head out shopping, is to make a list.  Take a look at your pantry to see the ingredients required for the upcoming week, essentials that are missing from the pantry, all of these shall be added to the list.  Your list should have exactly what you need to buy, the specific ingredient, variety and quantity you are looking to buy. </p>
      <p>2. Shop seasonal </p>
      <p>It's always a good idea, to plan your menu and eat seasonal fruits and vegetables. Just because your grocery store or supermarket is well stocked, doesn't mean that all of that fresh produce is in season. As produce changes from season to season, like the fresh produce displayed in summer might be way different from that in winter or monsoon, the supermarket will ensure everything is available. </p>
      <p>3. Shop according to your menu plan</p>
      <p>Always ensure, you have planned your meals, well in advance. Have a notepad  to plan and list out all the meals for each day of the week and the corresponding ingredients required. This way you wouldn't have missed out any ingredients and a consolidated list should be able to help you shop exactly according to your meal plan.</p>
      <p>4. Choose your shopping day/time wisely</p>
      <p> It is important to plan which day of the week you would be going shopping. Needless to say that weekends at supermarkets are super crowded, besides if you can squeeze in your visit to the grocery store during the weekdays is nothing like it. Less crowded, better organised shelves, shorter billing queues and  more patient staff, who are willing to help you out.</p>
      <p>5. Check supermarket offers</p>
      <p>Almost all supermarkets, have some kind of offers running throughout the year. Be a percentage of discounts on specific categories, or some buy one get one sort of offers, or some goodies free on specific products. </p>
