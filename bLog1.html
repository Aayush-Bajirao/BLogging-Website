      <p>Food waste is a very large problem in every home. With an average of at least 3 meals a day in affluent homes, not limiting the number of snacks and fruits that get eaten everyday. In times of crisis like we are going through right now with Coronavirus (Covid 2020), we need to think of multiple ways we can reduce contamination, garbage disposal and minimum contact with external garbage which is getting dumped on the streets and roads.</p>
      <p>1. Shop efficiently by planning your weekly meals</p>
      <p>Planning your weekly meals helps to you to shop efficiently and not overload our pantry and refrigerators with foods we are not going to be cooking. Pen down, what you plan to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner for 7 days of the week or for the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>2. Store fruits and vegetables in correct way</p>
      <p>Storing the leaves, vegetables and fruits in a right way will help preserve them for a longer time. Wash all the vegetables and fruits to remove dirt and contamination from external environments and handling. Do not wash the green leafy vegetables or herbs - wash them only as and when required.</p>
      <p>3. Learn to preserve cooked foods efficiently and save leftovers</p>
      <p>f you have cooked for more than one day, then a good idea would be to reheat food in individual plates so that reheated food does not get wasted and stale. Store them in airtight container and refrigerate them.</p>
      <p>4. Use the skins and peels of fruits & veggies</p>
      <p>Most skins and peels of vegetables can be used and eaten too. This way we dramatically reduce the amount of food waste we dump. When making a sabzi of potatoes, add the skin to it - weather its a baked dish, gravy or curry, stir fry or roast use the skin. </p>
      <p>5. Stick to staples</p>
      <p>If we donâ€™t get veggies - use dal, sooji, rice, besan, homemade dosa batter and keep your meals simple.</p>
